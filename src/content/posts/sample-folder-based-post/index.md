This is a test post to demonstrate how the folder-based approach works. The folder name `sample-folder-post` should become the slug for this post.

## Testing Image References

Here's an image that should be stored in the same folder:

![Forest.](forest.png)

Standard markdown image embed: 

```
![Forest.](forest.png)
```

Wikilink image embed: 

```
![[forest.png]]
```
## Benefits of Folder-Based Approach

- **Organization**: Keep all post assets in one place
- **Maintenance**: Easier to manage related files
- **Clarity**: Clear separation between different posts
- **Scalability**: Better structure for larger content collections
