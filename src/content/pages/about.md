Welcome to **Astro Modular**, an Astro blog theme template designed for Obsidian users, created by [David V. Kimball](https://davidvkimball.com). This theme turns Obsidian into a powerful CMS for instant blog publishing.

## Philosophy

Great content deserves great presentation without complexity. This blog theme is built on four core principles:

### Clarity First
Content should be the star, not the design. Every element is carefully crafted to enhance readability and focus attention on what matters most - your ideas and writing.

### Highly Performant
Fast loading times and smooth interactions are not optional. Every aspect of this theme has been optimized to deliver exceptional performance across all devices.

### Works with Obsidian
If you use Obsidian, this theme is a natural extension of your workflow. All rich markdown and extended markdown features, including Wikilinks, callouts, and other embedded features, display seamlessly between your vault and published site.

### Modular Design
Every feature can be toggled on or off through a single configuration file. Enable only what you need, keeping your site fast and focused on your specific use case.
